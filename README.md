## [Space Engineers DLC Unlocker](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker#space-engineers-dlc-unlocker)

### 🤖 All DLCs unlocked up to: `v1.202` - *Automatons* ✔️
🔬 The only one with all previous dlc files updated on release, so **NO MISSING blocks** ❗

>[💾 Click HERE to download](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or click the green **`Code`** button then **`Download ZIP`**

- 🕹️ ***Installation***:

  - Copy just the **"Content"** folder to the game directory, confirming file replacement:  
*from zip archive* -> "DLC Unlocker/**`Content`**"  
*to game (example)* -> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\ "  

  - If needed a backup of all files is included, same process as above but:  
*from zip archive* -> "Original backup/`Content`" -> *to game folder*

- ⚠️ ***Troubleshooting***:

  - If pasting the folder doesn't prompt you to replace files, you did something wrong:  
    Only the chosen `"Content"` folder must be placed inside the game folder:
    - the one **within** "DLC Unlocker" to unlock dlcs or  
    - the one **within** "Original backup" to restore default files

  - If the game hangs on "connecting" when joining a server:  
    Seems to be a conflict between some server-mod and the unlocker, you can try another server or  
    close the game and restore the backup files (included), then try to connect and play without the unlocker.  

  - It is no longer possible to paste dlc items contained in blueprints on a server:  
    Some game mechanics has been changed and sadly there is no way to fix this issue.  

  - If a block is locked by dlc, it is due to some mod that modifies it, making it appear protected by a dlc.  
    For example: using "Cockpits Re-Animated"<!--(https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2900331965)--> you will have Industrial Cockpit locked by dlc.  
    You can disable this kind of mods and play without them,  
     <details><summary>or you can just edit them, click here to show how.</summary><p>

    ————————————————————————————————————————  

    -Go to your Steam mods folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\244850\",  
    -Find the mod you want to edit (each folder is a codenamed mod, so you have to search for it),  
    -Open all ".sbc" files with notepad and delete all lines containing "DLC", example `<DLC>Warfare2</DLC>`.

    Warning: if that mod gets updated, you have to repeat this process!  
    But if you want to prevent updating, you can **copy the mod folder** in:

    "C:\Users\ YOUR ACCOUNT NAME \AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods" (AppData is hidden),  
    or paste this into an explorer window: `%AppData%\SpaceEngineers`, press Enter,  
    and if the "Mods" folder doesn't exist, create it.

    -Edit the mod's ".scb" files with notepad, deleting all lines containing "DLC" (the entire line),  
    -Rename the mod folder how you prefer (example: mod name + unlocked),  
    -Enter the ingame mods list and find it with that name and a HOME icon on the left.

    Home icon stands for local mod, and does not get touched from updates.  
    Now you can use this mod instead of the "original" without a dlc lock.

- 🔄 ***Important things you need to know for every new DLC release***:

  - ⛔ DO NOT ⛔ re-apply the unlocker if it hasn't been updated yet to the latest game version ❗
    - You can find other unlockers at the bottom of this page, if this is not updated.
  - If you want to play the game after a new dlc update, but before a new unlocker release:  
     <details><summary>this is what you need to know, click here to show.</summary><p>

    ————————————————————————————————————————  

     In this case, you will find new blocks locked and if there was some changes in previous dlcs files, those will appear blocked as well.  
     An example: A new dlc is released and previous Warfare dlc gets an update, the blocks you've already built still work, but you won't be able to build new ones from the Warfare dlc.  
     If this way the game is unstable or buggy, you'd better check the game files from Steam, then play without dlc blocks and wait for a new unlocker version.  

     This is how to start file checking:  

    - Directly from your browser:  

      Copy/paste this link into the url bar and press Enter (even with Steam closed)  
      ```
      steam://validate/244850
      ```

    - From Steam:  

      -Right click on Space Engineers, then Properties  
      -select Local Files on the left, then Verify integrity of game files.

- 📜 ***Notes***:

  - This unlocker is meant to unlock DLC blocks, so you can use them without paying for DLC.

    - Unfortunately, skins and emotes cannot be unlocked the same way, as they use a different method.
  
  - I will update the unlocker at every DLC release.

  - If you want to edit dlc files yourself, be careful because with each dlc update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the new dlc file (and miss blocks).

  - If you want to buy the game:
    - Space Engineers on [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
    - Space Engineers on [CDKeys.com](https://www.cdkeys.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=space%20engineers)
