    CreamAPI dll= ~700/800kb. Legit dll= ~290kb.
  - A - If it's a legit dll:
    - just remove `steam_api64_o.dll` and `cream_api.ini` and you are done!
  - B - If creamapi dll is still present:
    - Delete `steam_api64.dll` and `cream_api.ini`

- ⚠️ ***Troubleshooting:***

  - 🧯 If a game patch breaks the unlocker:

    - If you used the Tool: run `CreamAPI_Tool.cmd`,  
    if it recognizes that CreamAPI is no longer present, just press "**C**".

    - If you did manual installation, remove the file `steam_api64_o.dll` then redo "Manual Installation".  
    CreamAPI dll= ~700/800kb.  
    Legit dll= ~290kb.

    <br>

  - 🦠 If your antivirus detects "steam_api64.dll" as a malware, make an exception for it.  
    It's safe, but software houses don't like it when you play their dlcs for free.
  <br>

  - 🛡️ If you get the message "Windows protected your PC" when you launch "CreamAPI_Tool.cmd":  
    <details><summary>click here to show how to run it.</summary><p>

    ————————————————————————————————————————  
    ————————————————————————————————————————  

    It may happen that Windows shows you this message to prevent the execution of the file,  
    which is obviously just a batch that moves/copies/deletes files related to CreamAPI.

    How to run the Tool:


    - 1 - Press on "More info"
    <br>

    [<img src="https://i.ibb.co/16gFzwL/Windows10-Smart-Screen-Blocked1.png" width="500"/>](https://i.ibb.co/16gFzwL/Windows10-Smart-Screen-Blocked1.png)

    <br>
    <br>

    - 2 - Press on "Run anyway"
    <br>

    [<img src="https://i.ibb.co/DPdbCpz/Windows10-Smart-Screen-Blocked2.png" width="500"/>](https://i.ibb.co/DPdbCpz/Windows10-Smart-Screen-Blocked2.png)

    <br>

    - 3 - If the "Run anyway" button is missing:

      - Go to: Start menu, Settings, Update & Security,  
        Windows Security (on the left), App & Browser Control,  
        click on "Reputation-based protection settings",  
        in "Check apps and files": choose "WARN" or "OFF" (depends on your win version)

      - FAST alternative: copy/paste this into your browser url bar and press Enter,  
        then in "Check apps and files" choose "WARN" or "OFF" (depends on your win version):

      ```
      windowsdefender://smartscreenpua
      ```

- 📜 ***Notes:***

  - This unlocker is meant to unlock ONLY DLC blocks.
    - **Armor Skins and Emotes can NOT be unlocked.**  
      There is no way, cause Steam checks. You can use those of dlcs you own.
    - **It's NOT possible to paste DLC blocks contained in projects**,  
      in both online and offline worlds, with just base game.  
      A workaround is to use the mod "[Instant Projector](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2096677783)" as suggested in this [discussion](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker/discussions/44#discussioncomment-11069593).  

  <br>

  - I will update the unlocker if needed, or right after a new DLC release.
    - A new dlc requires to add a new dlc code in cream_api.ini. You can find the code [here](https://steamdb.info/app/244850/dlc).
    - If you want you can also add it by yourself, there are tips inside cream_api.ini (use notepad).
    - Do NOT remove owned dlcs from "cream_api.ini", leave the file as is or owned dlc blocks will be greyed out.

  <br>

  - What if I want the "Flush Cockpit" without registering for newsletter?
    - It's very simple, just enter a fake email address in the form. No confirmation required.

  <br>

  - An alternative to this tool is [CreamInstaller](https://github.com/CyberSys/CreamInstaller) ([NEW download page](https://github.com/sudojoao/CreamAPI)), compatible with a lot of games.
    - See [here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creaminstaller/), for updates and download.

  <br>

  - If you want to buy the game (or dlcs to unlock skins, emotes and blueprint pasting):
    - [Steam Store - Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
    - [CDKeys.com - Space Engineers](https://www.cdkeys.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=space%20engineers)

- ⚙️ ***How the Tool works, newbies proof:***

  - Installer:  
    The installer is used both to install CreamAPI and to check if everything is ok after a game patch.  
    What does it do exactly? if CreamAPI is not yet present so in the case of a new installation or  
    after an update that replaces the "steam_api64.dll" file,  
    it creates a backup of the new original file and installs/restores CreamAPI functionality.  
    So, if the game gets updated, you don't even have to download a new version of the unlocker,  
    just run the Tool to check and restore CreamAPI.  
    If you have an old CreamAPI version, it prompts you to update it by pressing "U".  
    The only time you need to update the unlocker is when a new DLC comes out.

  - Remover `Tool + press R`:  
    You can chose "R" again to just restore the backup, keeping creamapi files  
    or "E" to completely get rid of creamapi files while restoring the backup.  
    The remover first checks if the game has undergone an update that replaced  
    the "steam_api64.dll" file or if CreamAPI is still present, then removes it accordingly.
